Who said JavaScript cannot be blazingly fast?

# mik
`mik` is a JavaScript/TypeScript ahead-of-time compiler, written in Rust and powered by the LLVM backend. It delivers blazingly fast code execution and compact binary sizes.

## Name Choice
The name `mik` is derived from _Miklagarðr_, the Old Norse name for Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. _Miklagarðr_ literally means "the great city." `mik` aspires to be as great as Constantinople, akin to the grand city its name evokes.
